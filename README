# Terminal Bookmarks Manager

The terminal bookmarks manager (tbm) is a small commandline tool which makes it
easy to switch fast to often used directories.

# Tutorial

Assumption: tbm was installed and the ~/.bashrc was configured as described
below.

Add a bookmark:
{{{
> b .
> b /path/to/filename/also/possible
}}}

Add a bookmark with shortname:
{{{
> b /path/to/a/unhandy/filename fn
}}}

List all bookmarks (and change the current dir):
{{{
> b
}}}
'tbm' now asks you, where it should change to. Just enter a number.

Change dir to bookmark folder (by number):
{{{
> b 2
}}}

Change dir to bookmark folder (by name):
{{{
> b fn
}}}

Remove a bookmark:
{{{
> b r fn
}}}

# Installation

Copy file 'tbm' to a PATH'ed dir, for example on Ubuntu to '~/bin/'.

Tweak your '~/.bashrc'. Change the shortcut to your personal needs:
{{{
alias b=tbm
}}}
